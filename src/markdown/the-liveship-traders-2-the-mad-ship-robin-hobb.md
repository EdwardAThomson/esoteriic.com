**[The Liveship Traders (2) - The Mad Ship (Mass Market Paperback)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/RDMYYBEJVNH4P/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm "The Mad Ship")**

A worth sequel to the first book, it continues the main threads of the story but ends on a tantalizing revelation of what to expect in the third book. The sunken city in the Rain Wilds is finally revealed in this book and the author goes a long way to explain the relationship between the different factions (Chalced, Bingtown etc) and between the Liveships / Wizardwood / the Rain Wilds and the Serpents etc.  
  
Hobb keeps us in the dark about Paragon, his family and his past. That isn't fully revealed until the third book. Quite a surprise! As I said in my review for her first book, the trilogy is entirely coherent.
