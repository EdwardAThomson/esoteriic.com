## What is Esoteriic.com about?

The main theme of esoteriic.com is the **deciphering of reality**. It was an outlet for my desire to write, which in turn was an aide to order my thoughts about how I understood reality. This was not my very first ever blog, but the first I tried host and manage myself. It started in 2009 while I was in my mid-20s.

I focus on topics that I enjoy and have studied extensively, chiefly mathematics, physics, and cosmology, with explorations into logic, computing, technology, economics, philosophy, information security, blockchain and cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, and creative writing.

Favorite topics include symmetry, geometry, number theory, and computational cosmology. When I use the term "esoteric", I generally mean esoteric knowledge rather than occultism. While the latter has its place, I believe there are far more fascinating topics that conspicuously display hidden patterns - we just need to know where to look.

At esoteriic.com, content has always been given higher priority than website design (content > beauty). The site has evolved significantly since its humble beginnings in 2009 with a default Joomla template, through various WordPress iterations, and now to this custom-built static site generator hosted on GitHub.

## About Me

This website is created and maintained by one person with a deep love of knowledge and an insatiable curiosity about the universe. I'm originally an **Astrophysics PhD graduate** who made a switch to **Information Security**, and then to **blockchain**. The career change proved wise - job security is far better (no pun intended), the industry is growing rapidly, and it presents a wealth of interesting problems.

I completed an MSc in Information Security at Royal Holloway University of London and worked as an information security consultant, primarily doing penetration testing of web applications and infrastructure. I hold (or did hold) various information security certifications including CPSA, CRT and ISO 27001 Lead Implementer.

### Professional Background

My career has spanned both investment management, information security consulting, blockchain startup consulting, and various other roles in between. The transition from astrophysics to information security might seem unusual, but both fields require analytical thinking, pattern recognition, and the ability to solve complex problems with incomplete information.

## Writing and Creative Work

While this blog started as a technical and academic outlet, I eventually added creative writing (circa 2012/13). Most of my creative work falls into speculative fiction, particularly science fiction and fantasy. I'm drawn to stories that explore the impossible and ask "What if?" - whether that's faster-than-light travel, alien civilizations, or magical realms.

I've published a collection of short stories called **Terosan Tales** on Smashwords, featuring interconnected stories set in a science fiction universe I've been developing for over a decade. You'll find several of my short stories and creative writing pieces on this blog, organized under the "Creative Writing" category.

The creative writing was previously hosted on a separate WordPress blog, but I've now integrated it into this main site to create a more cohesive representation of my interests and work.

## AI and Technology Development

More recently, I've become deeply involved in AI development and AI-assisted programming. I believe AI represents a genuine technological breakthrough that goes beyond the hype, though it requires critical engagement rather than blind adoption. My approach is that **AI should augment, not replace human cognition**, at least in the short-term. In the long-term, I fear whether humans will ever be able to keep up.

I use AI as an active pair programmer, primarily through tools like Cursor, which allows for tight feedback loops with full codebase context. I delegate repetitive tasks like boilerplate code and syntax, while maintaining command over high-level architecture and creative problem-solving. The key insight is that AI isn't brain rot - it's a mirror. If you skip the heavy lifting, it keeps the bar low, but if you learn first and automate second, you get a cognitive dividend.

I've developed several open-source AI-powered applications, including **NovelWriter** (a comprehensive novel-writing assistant), **DungeonGPT** (an AI Dungeon Master for tabletop RPGs), and various tools for testing LLM creative writing capabilities. These projects embody my belief in building in the open to demystify AI technology.

## Interests and Preferences

**Mathematics vs Physics**: Despite being an astrophysics graduate, I find I enjoy doing mathematics more than reading about physics. Even more specifically, I prefer abstract ("pure") mathematics over applied mathematics. The logical nature of structures and patterns is more satisfying than digging into messy data. That said, applied work deals with real life while pure mathematics exists in more idealistic realms.

**Reading Preferences**: 
- **Fiction**: Mostly science fiction and fantasy. I'm fairly typical in that regard - I "only" like books with swords or laser guns. It's pure escapism, but far more fascinating than real life. Thinking about the unlikely or impossible stirs my mind and leads me to ask "What if?", "How could that problem be fixed?", "Will it always be like that?" - questions that align naturally with studying physics.
- **Non-Fiction**: Most of what I read relates to topics I write about here: mathematics, physics, economics, computing, and information security. I'm particularly interested when these fields intersect - computational cosmology, cryptography, and the mathematical foundations of various sciences.

**Music**: My tastes span multiple genres including classical, metal, rock, and electronic music. With limited time, I tend to focus deeply within genres rather than constantly exploring new artists, usually taking recommendations from people whose tastes align with mine.

## This Website - Technical Details

The site is built with a custom Node.js static site generator and hosted on GitHub. All content is written in Markdown and converted to HTML, allowing me to focus on writing rather than wrestling with complex publishing systems. The build process includes:

- Custom markdown processing with syntax highlighting
- Automatic category generation and organization  
- Responsive design with dark mode support
- SEO optimization and clean URL structure

## Categories and Content

The blog is organized into several main categories:

- **Creative Writing**: Original short stories and fiction
- **Writing Craft**: Articles about the craft and business of writing
- **Book Reviews**: Both fiction and non-fiction reviews
- **Blockchain and Cryptocurrency**: Technical analysis and market commentary
- **Mathematics and Physics**: Explorations of abstract concepts
- **Science, Technology and Nature**: Various writings about the universe
- **Information Security**: Information security insights
- **Finance and Investing**: Market analysis and investment strategies
- **Artificial Intelligence**: AI development philosophy, projects, and insights on human-AI collaboration

## Caveats and Philosophy

All articles should be treated as works in progress - I continuously edit and improve them. Some pages may be experimental as I test various approaches or technologies.

I'm not particularly fond of traditional "blogging" in the personal diary sense. This site concerns itself with ideas, analysis, and creative expression rather than personal life details. I believe there's more value in sharing knowledge and imagination than daily minutiae.

All views expressed here are my own and not those of any employer (past, present, or future).

## Connect

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/EdwardAThomson) where I share code projects and contribute to open source, or connect professionally on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-thomson-080ba519/).

I'm generally open to messages from readers. If you have questions about any of the topics I write about, or thoughts on my creative work, feel free to reach out.

Thanks for visiting Esoteriic.com. I hope you find something here that sparks your imagination, challenges your thinking, or simply entertains you for a while.
