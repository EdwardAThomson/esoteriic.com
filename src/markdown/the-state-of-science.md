Due to a lack of time and motivation I haven't posted anything here for a long time. It is perhaps ironic to come back to announce a departure.

There is a lot that I could say about the state of science in the modern world, I could rant about what is perceived to be science and what I believe science actually is. However, I'm not going to do that. I could discuss the issue of funding being cut to science in the UK, but I won't. There are many places out there on the web that tackle this. Instead, I'm merely going to link to a blog post about someone [leaving science](/web/20140423015405/http://blog.devicerandom.org/2011/02/18/getting-a-life/). The author was a researcher in Chemistry at Oxford but has decided to leave on account of science not fulfilling his expectations. I agree with the sentiment but my own experience has been slightly different. I'm not satisfied or fulfilled with academia hence I also intend to leave. Oddly, the comments are surprisingly well written (odd for the internet at least).
