# Introducing the “Open Accelerator”: A Free Resource for Web3 Founders

**tl;dr**: a free and public resource that guides web3 founders on project launches.

I’ve spent years in the blockchain and Web3 space, consulting for teams of various sizes and stages — from scrappy bootstrappers to venture-backed up-and-comers. One thing that’s common across all teams is the struggle to know what to do at each stage when launching. The early-stage process is opaque.

f you’ve ever explored an accelerator, you might’ve seen the glossy websites and enticing suggestions about capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities. But, in my experience, many accelerators come with a catch: they often demand significant equity **and** tokens, push questionable investment deals, or force you into a roadmap that might not serve your team’s best interests.

That’s why I created the [Open Accelerator](https://edwards-organization-16.gitbook.io/open-accelerator-for-blockchain-startups)

— a free, publicly accessible GitBook resource designed to help blockchain founders navigate the tough early stages. I’m not a VC, and I don’t run a “traditional” accelerator. My hope is to provide transparent, practical information so you can avoid the pitfalls I’ve witnessed too many times.

# Why an Open Accelerator?

The goal is simple: **remove the veil of mystery of launching a crypto project.**

The **Open Accelerator** is built on the belief that transparent, accessible knowledge helps everyone — especially founders — navigate one of the most dynamic (and at times volatile) markets on the planet.

I still very much believe in open source and that it is net beneficial to the world. I want to help founders understand the basics of building and launching a Web3 project — from pre-raise strategizing, to post-raise execution, all the way to product launch. No hidden fees or equity grabs, no forced token launches, and no questionable “advisors” lurking in the background. By putting all this information out in the open, I hope teams can learn at their **own pace** and make informed decisions that work for them.

**A Personal Note:** I got here after seeing multiple teams end up disappointed with typical accelerators — especially those pushing for token sales or rushed fundraising to benefit early investors. Is it right that they can demand (say) 5% of all tokens and all crypto-products sold (e.g. NFTs)?

Some programs do a fantastic job, but, in my opinion, they’re far fewer than you’d expect. Rather than join the noise, I wanted to create something different and truly neutral.

# What You’ll Find Inside

**1\. Pre-Raise Guidance**

-   **Legal and Organizational Basics**: Suggestions on how to structure your venture, [pick a jurisdiction](https://edwards-organization-16.gitbook.io/open-accelerator-for-blockchain-startups/fundraising/incorporation-of-token-issuing-entity), and handle compliance. **This not legal advice**. You will still need a lawyer.
-   **Pitch Deck Essentials**: Tips on crafting a clear, compelling narrative for [potential investors](https://edwards-organization-16.gitbook.io/open-accelerator-for-blockchain-startups/fundraising/finding-investors). There is a free [pitch deck](https://edwards-organization-16.gitbook.io/open-accelerator-for-blockchain-startups/fundraising/pitch-deck) [template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VHUszlBk6ta-x-74y5LnbzG65tKhobRH0mSAEQOde7c/edit#slide=id.p) inside!
-   **Tokenomics 101**: For projects considering token issuance, a realistic look at design, distribution, and sustainability.

**2\. Post-Raise Roadmap**

-   **Securing and Managing Funds**: Whether you raise through token sales or equity, guidance on using those resources responsibly.
-   **Team Expansion**: Suggestions on how to hire the right talent and set up an organizational structure that scales.
-   **Product Roadmapping**: Breaking down critical milestones for MVPs, testnets, or beta products in a Web3 context.

**3\. Launch Strategies**

-   **Technical Launch**: Smart contract deployment best practices, TGE (Token Generation Event) readiness, and security audits.
-   **Marketing and Community Building**: Creating a loyal community, leveraging social channels, and building brand trust in a notoriously skeptical market.
-   **Phased Rollout vs. All-In Launch**: Pros and cons of soft launches, phased releases, and full-scale public launches.

Each section is **modular** — you can jump around or focus on the parts that matter most to your project’s current stage.

# Who Is This Resource For?

-   **Early-Stage Web3 Teams**: Those who might have an idea or prototype but aren’t sure how to raise capital or develop a sustainable roadmap.
-   **Founders Exploring Blockchain**: Maybe you’ve launched a traditional startup and want to dip your toes into crypto. This resource helps you adapt to the crypto landscape for new opportunities.
-   **Investors & Advisors**: Even if you’re on the funding side, having a clearer picture of a team’s journey can make you a better partner.

# What Makes This Different from Traditional Accelerators?

**1\. No Pressure on Token Launches** Many accelerators push for token sales way too early because it’s financially beneficial for them or their investor friends. Here, you’ll learn some of the sensitivities of tokenizing your project — it’s your call, not mine or some VC’s.

While accelerators are happy to provide funding, they may have a strong opinion about how quickly you should launch a token. Be forth warned.

**2\. Neutral Guidance / Free, Open-Source Structure** The entire GitBook is free to read. You don’t owe me anything for access. This open format means you can adapt the advice to your situation and don’t need to sign away equity, tokens, or your soul just to get started.

The immediate downside is that there is no investment gained by simply reading a gitbook. However, there is a tried-and-tested process for raising money that’s outlined inside. Be prepared to talk with 50+ investors, but the process does work.

# My Consulting Services

While the Open Accelerator content is public and free, **I do offer paid consulting** for teams looking for hands-on support. I can’t guarantee you’ll walk away with millions in funding — that’s impossible for anyone to promise. What I can do is:

-   **Provide Expert Insight**: Offer tailored advice on pitch decks, investor outreach, tokenomics, governance models, or market strategies.
-   **Tailored Guidance Through Key Milestones**: Be your guide during crucial phases — negotiating with investors, launching a mainnet, or setting up community governance.

If that sounds like something that could benefit your team, don’t hesitate to reach out.

# LFG!

I hope this free resource can serve as your roadmap, giving you the fundamentals needed to pitch investors, organize your product strategy, and avoid the common traps that await many Web3 startups.

Feel free to dive into the GitBook, explore each section, and reach out if you’d like more direct support. Together, let’s keep building a healthier, fairer, and more open blockchain ecosystem — one startup at a time.
