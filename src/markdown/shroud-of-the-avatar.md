While I’m writing this blog I figured I’d give a heads up to [Shroud of the Avatar](https://www.shroudoftheavatar.com/). A computer game (hopefully) coming out in late 2014. Created by Richard Garriott and his team at Portalarium. Check it out!

The team ran a successful kickstarter campaign and continue to allow new subscribers to join on their website.

“Journey to the world of **Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues**, a computer role playing game created by **Lord British** (aka Richard Garriott), creator of the genre defining Ultima series of computer games, **Starr Long**, director of Ultima Online, and **Tracy Hickman**, author of the Dragonlance series. It combines rich story, like those of the single player Ultimas, with deep and varied multiplayer experiences, like Ultima Online.”
