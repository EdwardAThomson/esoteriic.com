**[Adventure Capitalist: The Ultimate Investor's Road Trip (Paperback)](/web/20160406004242/https://www.amazon.co.uk/review/RCIOI8T77GIE6/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm)**

**\[book review\]**

This book covers Rogers’s millennium car trip around the world. He tells the tale with an interesting mix of travel dialog, pictures, thoughts on local politics, and investment prospects. The first three are what you would expect of any travel diary, the last point is unique to Jim. Part of the recounting of this tale involves the comparison with his previous trip around the world when he went by motorcycle in the late 80s.

The journey started in Iceland in 1999 and took around 2 years to finish. The end point was his NY home (where lived at the time). During this time his wife planned their wedding, they organized dozens of visas, had guns pointed at them, exchanged money on the black markets of the world, moved their car by train and by boat, and the unfortunate death of his father.

If you are already a fan of his writing or speeches then this is probably the most enjoyable book he has on offer. If a travel book with investment insight appeals then you’d enjoy it too. It won’t appeal if you have a love of NGOs, bureaucracy, red tape, and paperwork. He blasts them all and often too.

This has inspired me to see more of the world but I’m a long way from being able to afford it!
