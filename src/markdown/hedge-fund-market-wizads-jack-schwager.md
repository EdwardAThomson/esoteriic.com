**\[book review\]**

**[Hedge Fund Market Wizards (Hardcover)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R3ENOOMJ9OU5PQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm "Hedge Fund Market Wizards")**

The book is a series of interviews with particular hedge fund managers that have the absolute best track records. Most of whom ran funds with a quantitative or statistical flavour. Schwager knows the subjects well enough to ask the right questions. The interviews seem natural although I suspect there has been a moderate amount of editing to ensure readability.

In short the book is highly readable and shouldn't cause any problems if you already have a fair grounding in the markets. Some of the terminology or concepts will sound esoteric to newcomers but I wouldn't say that the language nor much of the content is particularly abstruse. This book will appeal to those who enjoy reading about markets and/ or hedge funds, particularly those hedge funds that have run "obscure" strategies (this is more advanced than 'simple' equity long / short methods).

Content wise I'd say I learnt a lot about how each of the managers think, so a lot of the content was new to me. There is a lot of ideas to learn here and I now have a lot of extra reading I want to do in order to find out more. I've already started to read up more on interest rates.

My favourites: Colm O'Shea, Ed Thorp, Jamie Mai.
