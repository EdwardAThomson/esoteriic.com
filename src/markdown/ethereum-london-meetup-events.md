The Ethereum London group on meetup.com was one of the first meetup groups for Ethereum in the world and at the time of writing it is the largest with almost 4,600 members. The recent events have taken a mostly lecture format followed by a pub visit.

If you live near-by or happen to be passing though London then I'd suggest checking out the group and attending one of the meetups in the near future. There 4 meetups planned which will see us until the end of the year. I would warn you that the attendance list fills up quickly so you might not be able to get a space; however, if you are on the waiting list then you still have a good chance of getting in. Just turn up to the event early and wait for the confirmed list to take their seats. I'm fairly confident that there will be many no-shows which means those on the waiting list will have a chance to get inside.
