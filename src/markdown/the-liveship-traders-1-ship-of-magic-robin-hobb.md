**\[book review\]**

I highly enjoyed this series of books and feel that the descriptions are fantastic, she has created very real characters and a wholly believable world. The plot is well thought out and fits together coherently across the whole series. I think this series is comparable in many ways to GRR Martin's Song of Fire & Ice (Game of Thrones) series. Both are high quality modern fantasy that engage the reader with the story. Neither are perfect but overall a great read.  
  
The first book was obviously good enough that I wanted to the buy the sequels and read on. It feels well written but not complicated at all, if anything GRRM's books can get a little bit complicated (part of the charm but also requires more effort to follow). I haven't read her other books so it is hard for me to compare with those, I recently started to read the Assassin's trilogy which is good but feels less mature.
