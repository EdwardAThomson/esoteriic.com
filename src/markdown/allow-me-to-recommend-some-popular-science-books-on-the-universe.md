For those who are interested in brushing on their knowledge of Cosmology, i.e. the study of the Cosmos (‚ÄúUniverse‚Äù), then I would like to recommend the following books. While there is a lot of good info on the web already (wiki is updated by experts I know for a fact) I still believe in having a good book that presents a structured and coherent account of the modern understanding of the Universe. Understandably, the books are not necessarily easy to read but I also believe that the effort will provide its own rewards. Such topics still fill me with wonder despite any cynicism I sometimes convey when asked about professional research: the topics are interesting and that is something I haven‚Äôt forgotten. So here is a brief list of my top picks‚Ä¶

*Stephen Hawking‚Äôs Universe ‚Äì David Filkin*

This book is the easiest one to dive into and finish without any headaches. Better yet, this is actually a simpler version of Hawking‚Äôs book ‚ÄúA brief history of time‚Äù. So if you have fancied reading that book but were too afraid then try this one first. The great thing about the book is that it covers the history of the key people in the scientific revolutions that lead to our modern day understanding of the cosmos *and* it covers the history of the Universe as we know it. The book is also a companion to the TV series although I never saw that. Finally, it is full of colourful pictures and well worth every penny you pay for it.

Once you have read it the I thoroughly recommend that you go on to read A Brief History of Time.

*A brief history of time ‚Äì Stephen Hawking*

I read this book more than 10 years ago now, I actually borrowed a copy of the original version of the book and read it within a week (I‚Äôm not a fast reader but I was a teenager then). I thoroughly enjoyed it and soon after I purchased my own copy which is the 10th anniversary edition. Before I read this book I actually read Stephen Hawking‚Äôs Universe ([Stephen Hawking‚Äôs Universe: The Cosmos Explained](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0465081983/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk)), which I found to be good preparation. At the time my knowledge of physics was that of high school level physics, which is enough to get you through both books. Both cover a bit of history of the key figures in the development of astronomy / cosmology but this book eventually goes into greater detail of the more difficult concepts.

*Black Holes & Time Warps ‚Äì Kip S Thorne*

One of my favourite books and also one of the most influential. I read this in my teens, about 12 years ago, in the same summer that I read Hawking‚Äôs Brief History of Time. Although I skimmed through the book again before writing this review. üòâ This book is perhaps easier to read and like Hawking‚Äôs book is full of diagrams to aid understanding. Some relativity is covered, including the idea of lightcones and how they relate to causality. This was actually one of the trickier concepts, in that I tried to fully understand what the lightcone diagram meant and what the consequences are of the information displayed upon one. They are key to understanding black holes and how they distort space-time.
