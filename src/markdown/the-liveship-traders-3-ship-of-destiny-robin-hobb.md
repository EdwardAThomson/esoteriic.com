**[Ship of Destiny (The Liveship Traders, Book 3) (Paperback)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R1N4OS9FUF2AZE/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm "Ship of Desinty")**

I knew there is a lot of plot to get through in third book and even halfway through I wasn't sure how she was going to pull it all together in time. Strangely, all threads are pulled together and there is closure on all outstanding lines of the story. Some parts of the plot could have easily filled another entire book, such as war between Chalced and Bingtown. \*Spoiler\*: The introduction of a dragon to win the fight feels a little bit of a cheat but not wholly unfair given the build up to it.  
  
The pulling together of the main characters towards the end of the book seems a little bit improbable but not implausible. It certainly ties them altogether quite neatly. The final revelation of who Paragon is, is actually more of a shocker than the relationship between the serpents and dragons. I won't say any more on those but leave it for the reader.
