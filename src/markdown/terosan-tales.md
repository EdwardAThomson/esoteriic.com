Finally! I managed to get something published. Ok, so it is self-published rather than through a traditional publishing house but it is a milestone none-the-less. It is something that I could have / should have done years ago.

I’ve been writing for years and wandered aimlessly through the self-publishing (killing?) fields without actually pulling the trigger. In 2013 I created a new Twitter account for my creative writing and have engaged in some writing chatter. After year of wandering I decide that I should get something published. Anything. I enjoy writing and I think that the universes I’ve created are interesting and intriguing. Eventually, I came across **Smashwords** and decided that was the best way to go. And now I can present my first finished published work (excluding my PhD thesis of course, does that even count?):

Four short stories set in the same universe which are the beginnings of a larger tapestry of interwoven stories.

For a brief summary of each story click on “Continue reading”:

*General background*

Terosan Prime is a planet-spanning city that sits at the heart of the Terosan Galactic Republic. A democratic power that spans numerous star systems with majority control of their galaxy. Their power is only rivaled by the large consortium of corporate planest who are collectively known as Kyopix. The latter were once wealthy Terosan merchants but broke away to form their own “civilization” with a set of rules that’s less restrictive. Trade between the two is prosperous and the hostility is mostly confined to heated negotiations.The gaps between these two powers is full of independent star systems; they are the unconquered, the resistive, the destroyed, or the unknown. Living free but sandwiched between two super-powers does not make for easy living.This is a universe of empires, computer hackers, gamblers, merchants, nomads, killers and faster-than-light travel.

Further background reading in a previous blog post: [Terosan background details](http://esoteriic.com/author/96/).Stories in this volume: “Deck 20″, “Fallen Gods of Cheam”, “The Pirate Queen”, “Gnir’s Raid”.

*Deck 20*

Terosan is a sprawling planet-wide city. It is the centre of the Terosan Galactive Republic and therefore the major seat of power in the galaxy. The military of the TGR is arguable the strongest in the galaxy and Terosan Prime, the capital planet, is clearly the most populated with the largest economy. It dominates all.

In this modern metropolis everything is monitored. Security begets stability. Crime is low and the citizens can live in peace. As can be expected in such conditions, crime isn’t absolutely zero. The areas with the highest crime rares are at the bottom of the sky-scraping towers where the power people live. Deck 20 is a story of a boy who ventures outside to play in the streets, against his father’s wishes and ends up on the wrong side of the law.

*Fallen Gods of Cheam*

Cheam is a backwards planet by Terosan standards. Sentiment life exists but the civilizations are primitive. Although on a world covered in ice it shouldn’t be a surprise. Survival is the highest priority and nothing else even comes close. Despite such harsh conditions life is able to exist but not exactly flourish.

The Cheamans are primitive and superstitious but not stupid. This story concerns a hunting expedition of a tribal leader and his closest companions who eventually confront the twilight of their gods.

*The Pirate Queen*

Being born poor doesn’t mean that you have to die poor. This pirate queen lives in the gaps between Terosan and Kyopix. She plays against the both of them and raids who she pleases to make a comfortable but risky living for herself. She doesn’t work alone, of course, but rather she commands a small fleet of ships filled with a loyal crew.

If anything, life seems too easy. Luck faltered when this queen was eventually captured but she was given an opportunity of a lifetime, one that would allow her to walk free and make more wealth than she ever had before. With great rewards comes great risk.

*Gnir’s Raid*

Hacking. It ain’t easy. Few people can do it, even fewer can do it without getting caught. In a world where everything is tagged and closely monitored then escaping the surveillance isn’t easy. One of the most prolific hackers thinks he’s found a secret but disused government owned information stash. Is he right and what can he do about it?
