**\[book review\]**

I decide to re-read the hobbit after watching the newly released film (an unexpected journey). Yes, I probably should have re-read before but never mind. For reference, the film covers the first 35% of the book in terms of plot progression, although it adds many scenes that are unwritten in the book. This should not be seen with any worry but rather welcomed as the film is exploring some of the additional info/story that you really want to know about.  
  
Interestingly, Tolkien gets away with many things in the hobbit that modern writers aren't allowed to do, or not supposed to at least, such as a lot of narration and an omnipotent point of view. This is perhaps where the hobbit shows its age but we can forgive this given that we know when it as published, and I think we can forgive this given that it was written as a children's novel but continuous to appeal to a wide audience 75 years later. There are some archaic expressions but the language isn't difficult. Through out the book you will find poetry that fits with the story and while I enjoyed it there are many that skip it (they aren't essential to the plot); you may also notice that even in the Tolkien's prose often has nice flowing rhythms.  
  
Further to this we know that the story was written for his own kids and for his own satisfaction rather than to make a quick buck. Nor should it be understated the amount of knowledge and research that the story draws upon from the author's academic studies of the old European languages and sagas. For me this is one of the stronger points, Tolkien brings together many classic sagas but adds his own ideas to produce something new (at the time), and something which others have struggled to copy.  
  
The story's hero, Bilbo, was obviously written with the intention of being likeable by kids; Bilbo is shorter and physically weaker than the other protagonists yet he is a key member of the team, he uses his size and deftness to his advantage which will appeal to kids who want to show that they are the equal of adults. The only flaw there is that Bilbo is a full grown adult in Hobbit terms which will be off putting for a child as they cannot identify with such a large age gap. The character has a wide appeal as he is slow to temper and kind of heart.  
  
I originally read my mother's copy which was published in the early 70s but only just bought my own copy, the 75th anniversary hard back in pocket size. The cover features a mountainous landscape that is supposed to be drawn by Tolkien himself and I believe it was intended as the original cover.  
  
While the cover seems like an amateur drawing it has a warm appeal to it that fits with the story, Tolkien is more fond of nature that the cold and clinical niceties of modernity. It shows all his works as well as in his artwork and not something to be overlooked. There are about 10 illustrations that are black and white (pen?) drawings by Alan Lee, which are, again, entirely fitting with the style of this book.
