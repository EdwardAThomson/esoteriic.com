Continuing with the world domination, Google provides its answer to social networking: http://wave.google.com/

The video (currently) on the front page is 1hour 20 minutes and isn't _that_ interesting. Most of the features are explained two or three times and anyone that has used a computer for long enough will already understand the main idea after 10 minutes.

In short, wave centralizes: Email / instant messaging / Networking (blogging / picture sharing) with the ability to make conversations/brainstorming accessible to a group. It seems to be heavily promoting collaborative efforts and doing that in real time. It is neat and seems like an obvious extension of gmail.

Is this the end of other social networking sites? Probably not. You can link twitter into your wave objects although not sure about the other social networking sites. I already use Google for my email, web searching and RSS feeds. I'm most likely going to use their translation services when needed too (needs more development). It seems that Wave (tm?) will all these services into one place.
