**[Stephen Hawking's Universe: The Cosmos Explained (Paperback)](/web/20160405003109/http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R2IMNGXCC5AL31/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm "Stephen Hawking's Universe")**

This book is the easiest one to dive into and finish without any headaches. Better yet, this is actually a simpler version of Hawking's book "A brief history of time". So if you have fancied reading that book but were too afraid then try this one first. The great thing about the book is that it covers the history of the key people in the scientific revolutions that lead to our modern day understanding of the cosmos and it covers the history of the Universe as we know it. The book is also a companion to the TV series although I never saw that. Finally, it is full of colourful pictures and well worth every penny you pay for it.
