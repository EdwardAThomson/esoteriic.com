After chatting about FTL and time travel on Twitter I reminded myself about the phrase “Deus Ex Machina” (literally, God from the machine).  From Wiki: It is a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object.

Please, no, don’t do it.
