Quick post: it is worth taking your credit / debit card receipt when paying by contactless.

Why: if you take the receipt you will notice that there is a card number displayed in full without the stars (“\*”). Not everytime, but too many times. Personally, I think that is bad practice although not actually illegal in terms of a contract breach under laws of payment card use (PCI DSS).

The number being printed on your copy is “fine” since it is your number, and it is “fine” to be on the merchant copy since they are supposed to dispose of the receipts securely, too often receipts are just thrown in the bin. 🙁

When paying by chip and pin the card number is always hidden with stars (except the last 4 digits). This number is the same as the one display along your card. The number printed when using contactless is actually different, but just poor practice.

Note: I wrote this with some paranoia in mind. The underlying issue may not even be a problem, but at the time of writing I did worry about it being a security concern. (comment from July 2025!).
