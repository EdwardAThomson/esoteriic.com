My older blog posts were mostly from a financial perspective rather than a technical perspective. It is interesting to re-read these. In the first post the price of Bitcoin was $12 and in a later post the price was $750. FYI, these posts are also preserved in the Internet Archive (Way Back Machine).

# Learning about blockchain

I also created a page that that links to many other useful websites to help people start learning about blockchain.
