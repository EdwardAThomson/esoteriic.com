By now we can see that Google is taking over the world and internet by becoming a central host of all things useful and useless. If you need something that you just 'google' it, google is no longer the name of a company but also a verb. In their conquest of the world they have just released something that will help them translate their demands ("take me to your leader") into all languages:

I gave it a simple test and it returned what I expected (a good start):

I would like a glass of beer (English) -> Jeg vil gjerne ha et glass øl (Norwegian)

Jeg vil gjerne ha et glass øl -> I'd like a glass of beer (contractions are fine with me)

Part of Google's success at becoming the most renown and best search engine is their ability to use statistics to come to the most likely conclusion. Hence I expect their expertise in statistics is going to make this translation application the most reliable and most used translation service on the web (plus it helps that Google is one of the most famous brands companies on the planet). This will certainly be my first port of call for machine translation. Danke schoen / tusen takk / cheers pal Google.

Any chance we can get this to translate into Klingon?
