My thoughts on recent developments in software. Second time writing this, damned back end of the website ate the first attempt. This version is not so erudite. :-/

Apple:

The [Google CEO](http://mashable.com/2009/08/03/eric-schmidt-apple/) just left the board at Apple.

Too many conflicts of interest as Google muscles into Apple's markets. Good luck to Google; I've never liked Apple or their products.

Microsoft:

[Microsoft](http://www.cio.com/article/497585/Microsoft_Stuns_Linux_World_Submits_Source_Code_for_Kernel)'s donation of code to Linux is positive from my perspective. I use Windows at home but Linux at work, more integration between the two should be beneficial. I'm sure Microsoft are hoping to make a profit as well as make their business sustainable into the future. Although Linux fans claim the code was entered under duress.

Google:

A company that do \*almost\* no wrong has just announced that it will release an operating system based upon Linux. It will be open source and hence free to use. This is a massive play in the battle between Microsoft and [Google](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html) for popularity
