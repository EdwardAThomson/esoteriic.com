**\[book review\]**

Is this book about hedge funds? Sorta. Will it help you to find / analyse / trade in hedge funds of the markets? No, not at all. The author is been in the industry for decades and has been involved in a few hedge fund ventures as well as working at Morgan Stanley.  
  
I have mixed feelings on this book. It isn't terrible but it isn't great. The advice to be gleaned from this book is not hard facts but more about boosting one's soft skills in investing. That in itself is not bad but I don't think there is anything new here (for me), e.g. Ben Graham covered the psychological battles that an investor faces in the Intelligent Investor, as have many others.  
  
The style of the book is that of a memoir, the structure is quite chaotic with no real discernible structure such as chronological nor by theme. It is messy at every level; you could even see it as fractal structure, the sentences are often as mixed up as the overall structure. That's not to say that any part is unclear. Despite what I've just said the book is easy to read in part because the level of detail is fairly simple. There is no explanation of strategies or any real in-depth analysis, but rather a loose compendium of stories.  
  
This is a light and somewhat entertaining read but by no means essential reading. It looks like I'm the first person to review this book since 2009.
