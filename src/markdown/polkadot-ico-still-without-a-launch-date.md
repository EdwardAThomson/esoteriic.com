The Web 3 Foundation announced that there would be a fundraising event for the Polkadot network. The intention was to provide a sale start date by mid-August with a 14 day countdown.

WHEN ICO ?
----------

**At the time of writing there is no launch date or 14 day countdown.**

The sale has been delayed, in part, due to the SEC announcement at the [end of July](https://steemit.com/law/@edwardthomson/investor-bulletin-initial-coin-offerings-sec-offers-clarity). Once more details have been announced I will be sure to post them here. Hang tight!

Polkadot on Medium
------------------

In other news, Polkadot now has an official Medium page: [Polkadot Network](https://medium.com/polkadot-network)

Polkadot Market
---------------

On the back of the previous announcement I created a subreddit "[Polkadot Market](https://www.reddit.com/r/polkadot_market/)" to discuss the ICO and also to provide a space for future conversations on token trading.

What is Polkadot?
-----------------

In case you don't know what Polkadot is, here's a reminder....

Stephan Tual, former CCO Ethereum, provides a simple overview of the project on his blog [Introduction to Polkadot: what it is, what it ain't](https://blog.stephantual.com/web-three-revisited-part-two-introduction-to-polkadot-what-it-is-what-it-aint-657782051d34)
