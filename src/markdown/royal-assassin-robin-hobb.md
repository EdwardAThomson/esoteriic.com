**[Royal Assassin (The Farseer Trilogy - Book 2) (Paperback)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R2SUMIP5QYNENV/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm "Royal Assassin")**

**\[book review\]**

I found the first book to be slightly unengaging at times but this part is far more engaging. There is a greater sense of danger with the characters and the author has created more conflict which moves the plot along well. The key ideas / themes are further explored, building upon those introduced in the first book but the reader finds a greater understanding in this book. Of importance is greater insight into the Skill and the Wit. These passages are the ones I find the most interesting.  
  
I think that if the first book truly put you off this series then the second book won't be enough of an improvement, however if you are undecided about the series then I think the second book should be more enjoyable and encourage you to read on to the third book.  
  
The first point of view restricts you to the main character's point of view, not a total failing but sometimes I wish I could be in the mind of another character. The main character is likeable but I think this series would have worked better from a mix of perspectives.
