# Relaunching My Website: A Journey of Migration, Modernization, and AI Integration

After years of running my blog on WordPress and various hosting platforms, I decided it was time for a complete relaunch. What started as a simple desire to save hosting costs evolved into a comprehensive modernization project that showcased the power of AI-assisted development. Here's the story of how I rebuilt my entire web presence from the ground up.

## The Motivation: More Than Just Cost Savings

My original setup was becoming increasingly cumbersome:

- **WordPress Complexity**: Years of plugins, themes, and customizations had created a bloated system
- **VPS Hosting Costs**: Running multiple sites on a VPS was expensive for what was essentially static content
- **Content Fragmentation**: My writing was scattered across WordPress, Medium, and various other platforms
- **Limited Control**: I wanted complete ownership of my content and presentation

The goal was simple: create a unified, cost-effective, and maintainable platform for all my writing.

## The Technical Challenge: From WordPress to Static

### Legacy Content Migration

The first major hurdle was extracting years of content from WordPress. My blog contained:

- **150+ blog posts** spanning over a decade
- **Multiple categories** including fiction reviews, technical writing, and creative works
- **Complex formatting** with embedded images, code blocks, and custom styling
- **Intricate URL structures** that needed to be preserved for SEO

### The Custom Solution Approach

Rather than using existing static site generators like Jekyll or Hugo, I decided to build a custom solution using Node.js. This decision was driven by:

1. **Complete Control**: Full customization of the build process
2. **Specific Requirements**: Unique needs for content processing and categorization
3. **Learning Opportunity**: Chance to understand every aspect of the system
4. **AI Integration**: Easier to extend with AI-powered features

## The AI Revolution: Cursor and Pair Programming

The game-changer in this project was working exclusively within the **Cursor IDE** with AI assistance. This wasn't just about code completion—it was true pair programming with AI.

### How AI Transformed the Development Process

**Content Processing Scripts**: AI helped write complex scripts to:
- Parse WordPress export files
- Convert HTML to clean Markdown
- Extract and organize metadata
- Handle image migration and optimization

**Build System Architecture**: Together with AI, we designed:
- A modular build pipeline
- Category management system
- Template rendering engine
- Redirect handling for SEO preservation

**Problem-Solving Partnership**: When facing challenges like Medium's anti-scraping measures, AI helped:
- Analyze the problem space
- Suggest multiple solution approaches
- Debug complex Puppeteer automation
- Optimize for performance and reliability

### The Cursor IDE Experience

Working in Cursor felt like having a senior developer as a constant pair programming partner:

```javascript
// AI helped write complex content processing logic
function processWordPressContent(htmlContent) {
    const $ = cheerio.load(htmlContent);
    
    // Remove WordPress-specific elements
    $('.wp-block-separator').remove();
    $('.sharedaddy').remove();
    
    // Convert to clean Markdown
    return turndownService.turndown($.html());
}
```

The AI understood context, remembered previous decisions, and could suggest improvements based on the entire project structure.

## Technical Architecture: A Modern Static Site

### The Build Pipeline

The final system consists of several key components:

1. **Content Processing**: Scripts to convert various formats to Markdown
2. **Template Engine**: Custom HTML generation with modern CSS
