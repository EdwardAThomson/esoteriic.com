Their motto is "Decentralise Everything" so instantly I was hooked. I watched some videos on YouTube to get a feel for it and most things I heard were positive. So I figured I'd dig a little deeper before parting with my money. That's when I came across FAQ point 24:

>   
> "24. What does block.one plan to use proceeds from the EOS Token distribution for?As a private company, proceeds of the EOS Token distribution will be utilized by block.one in its sole discretion. block.one intends to use certain of the proceeds for general administration and operating expenses, as well as to build a blockchain consulting business focusing on helping businesses re-imagine or build their businesses on the blockchain, developing more open source software that may be helpful to the community and building decentralized applications using [EOS.IO](http://eos.io/) Software."

Uh... so it doesn't sound like they are building anything. I wanted to believe but the FAQ has me spooked. The largest ICO so far and it is making me scratch my head.
