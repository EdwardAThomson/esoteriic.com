**[Assassin's Apprentice (The Farseer Trilogy, Book 1) (Kindle Edition)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R1ZHLW71F3KH05/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm "Assassin's Apprentice")**

I enjoyed it but I don't think it is the best thing she's written by a long way. The characters were likeable enough and realistic enough that I could find enough enjoyment to finish the book but it lacked that something extra that would make it great. I've read Hobb's Liveship trilogy, which I highly rate, but this book isn't as good.  
  
This book is told from the first person perspective and follows a single main character. It feels a bit strange to read in first person after reading so much in third person, even the Liveship trilogy is mostly third. As this book only follows one character it is perhaps no surprise that it is first person. The number of characters is fairly small too. Overall it feels like the world is limited in size / scope, although there are hints of a potentially much larger setting.
