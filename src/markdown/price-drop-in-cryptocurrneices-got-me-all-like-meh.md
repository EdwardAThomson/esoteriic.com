The price has fallen but the technology hasn't changed. I've lost count of the number of reasons as to why the price has fallen:

*   Whales cashing out.
*   Vitalik's death.
*   Hackers.
*   Pumpers and dumpers.
*   The Chinese.
*   SegWit in Bitcoin... and so on.

People love to tell themselves stories about why the price is falling, but really it doesn't matter. There is perhaps some satisfaction in believing a story in order to satisfy curiosity but in too many cases it is meaningless. We are all too easily fooled by randomness.

Where to?
---------

When the price of ETH hit $150 (on the way up) I thought it was over-bought. Not long afterwards I remember telling a couple of friends who wanted to get involved at ~$220 that I thought ETH was seriously over-bought. Little did I know that the price would drop to somewhere circa $170 (possibly less) before rocketing up to $400.

If I thought ETH was over-bought at $150 then it should be pretty clear why I'm not fussed about the price today (circa $157).

And so where to? Probably down. I wouldn't be surprised to see the price cut in half. If the price bounced off $50 before wandering around for a few months or more I really wouldn't be surprised either. I don't expect the price to stay down there forever, of course, but rapid bursts in price always correct sharply. It happened in Bitcoin in 2013 and happened in Gold in 2011. Honestly: chasing peaks will always end in tears.
