A link to my [Amazon reviews](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A2OF2RS9NKC5IW "Amazon Reviews"). Mostly book reviews are in the narrow range of sci-fi/fantasy, science, maths, finance, economics, investing. What can I say? I tend to read what I like and most of the stuff I've bothered to review are books that I enjoyed (although not always).

Go read. Rate.

Unfortunately users of the Amazon website tend to thumb down reviews that they disagree with, regardless of the logic of the points of view expressed. I've tried to stray away from books that I'd review negatively. Don't see the point of reviewing something to have it instantly thumbed down by fanatics of that book / author. The converse is also true for books with a positive rating. People will thumb those down if they disagree too, although it seems that (in general) people are less likely to do so.

The thumbing system asks you whether you found the review helpful not 'did you agree with the content?'
