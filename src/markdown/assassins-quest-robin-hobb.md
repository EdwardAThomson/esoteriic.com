**\[book review\]**

While I greatly enjoyed the series and liked Fitz as a main character I did feel slightly let down by this final book. It is slightly longer than it needs to be and seems to take an age to get to the end, then it feels like the ending is over too quickly. As you would expect all the plot lines are tied up at the end and most of the events are quite predictable. There are no surprises a la GRR Martin, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing either.  
  
The series as a whole is strong and even this book is enjoyable but I was still hoping for something more interesting in this final book. Unfortunately I can't say too much without giving away the plot, but if you have read the first two then I'm sure you will read this. You might be slightly disappointed but that doesn't mean it is a terrible book.  
  
I would have given it 3.5 stars but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and go with a 4.
