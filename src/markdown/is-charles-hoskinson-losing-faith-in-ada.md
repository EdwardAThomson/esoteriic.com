# Is Charles Hoskinson Losing Faith in ADA?

**TL;DR**: Two near-term outflows (ADA to BTC, NIGHT unlocks) could be bearish for ADA

## Short Summary

* **Treasury shake-up.** On **13 June 2025** Charles Hoskinson proposed converting **≈ $100 million of ADA** in the on-chain treasury into **Bitcoin and stablecoins (USDM, USDA)**.<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>  
* **Market reaction.** ADA slid **≈ 4–6 %** in the two trading sessions that followed, losing the key **$0.60** level before finding support near **$0.58**.<sup>[2](#ref2)</sup><sup>[3](#ref3)</sup>  
* **Token-supply overhang.** A separate June announcement unveiled **24 billion "NIGHT" tokens** to be airdropped via Midnight's *Glacier* drop, plus dual-reward staking that issues **NIGHT + ADA**.<sup>[4](#ref4)</sup><sup>[5](#ref5)</sup>  
* **Why that matters.** The BTC pivot and extra emissions deepen near-term sell pressure on ADA while expanding total Cardano-ecosystem supply into a market with muted alt-coin demand.  
* **Long-term upside is still possible** if Bitcoin holdings appreciate and are recycled into buy-backs, and if Midnight's privacy layer drives real activity—but neither catalyst helps holders **today**.

Although I'm not super optimistic.

## 1. A Treasury Bet on Bitcoin

Hoskinson's livestream proposal would trade **≈ 140 million ADA** (5–10 % of the $1.2 billion treasury) for BTC and regulated stablecoins. He argues the move will: (1) prime Bitcoin-based DeFi on Cardano, (2) generate non-inflationary yield to **buy back ADA later**, and (3) showcase Cardano's stablecoin rails.<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>

From a capital-structure lens, however, the treasury would be **selling its own equity (ADA)** to buy an external asset. Equity investors typically read that as management signaling the equity is over-valued—hence the swift price drop.<sup>[2](#ref2)</sup>

> **Price action:** ADA fell ~4 % on the first full day after the stream, extending a 35 % YTD draw-down.<sup>[2](#ref2)</sup><sup>[3](#ref3)</sup>

## 2. The NIGHT Token & Dilution Math

Midnight—a zero-knowledge privacy side-chain backed by IOG—will distribute **24 billion NIGHT**:

* **Eligibility:** ADA, BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, AVAX, BNB, BAT holders (snapshot 11 June 2025).<sup>[5](#ref5)</sup>  
* **Unlock schedule:** 25 % of allocations unlock every 90 days (fully unlocked after 360 days).<sup>[4](#ref4)</sup>  
* **Staking:** ADA stakers now earn **ADA *plus* NIGHT** rewards.

Unless NIGHT accrues real fees (I don't place much value on governance), the extra token stream is pure supply inflation on top of ADA's own supply inflation:

| Metric | ADA | NIGHT |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Max supply** | 45 bn | 24 bn |
| **Circulating (Jul 2025)** | 35.38 bn ADA<sup>[7](#ref7)</sup> | 0 bn (vesting begins Q3-25) |
| **Annual inflation** | ≈ 3.9 % ADA<sup>[8](#ref8)</sup> | 100 % first year (airdrop) |

**Key worry:** Aggregate demand for alt-coins is already thin; adding > 50 % extra units in the ecosystem may sap liquidity from ADA rather than expand the pie.

## 3. Short-Term Price-Pressure Checklist

| Pressure Point | Mechanism | Timing | Net Effect |
|----------------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Treasury BTC swap | OTC sale of ≈ 140 m ADA | Execution window "over a week" | Sell-side flow → **bearish**<sup>[6](#ref6)</sup> |
| NIGHT unlocks | 6 bn tokens unlock Q3-25 | Starts Jul–Aug 2025 | Airdrop recipients may dump → **bearish**<sup>[4](#ref4)</sup> |
| Dual-reward staking | Continuous | Ongoing | Structural sell pressure unless NIGHT utility emerges |
| BTC-funded ADA buy-backs | Triggered only after BTC yield/appreciation | Medium / long term | Potentially **bullish later** |

**Bottom line:** Two near-term outflows (ADA → BTC, NIGHT unlocks) hit before any inflows (BTC yield → ADA buy-backs). Expect downside volatility until at least the first NIGHT cliff in mid-September.

## 4. Long-Term Scenarios

| Scenario | Drivers | Price Impact by 2026 |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| **Bull:** BTC treasury grows 50 %; Midnight privacy dApps gain traction. | BTC bull market; regulatory clarity on ZK privacy. | ADA retests 2021 highs (>$2). |
| **Base:** BTC reserve flat; modest Midnight use; Cardano scaling delivers incremental TPS. | Organic L2 growth; stiff ETH/SOL competition. | ADA ranges $0.50–$1.00. |
| **Bear:** BTC flat/falls; NIGHT overhang persists; DeFi TVL stagnates. | Risk-off macro; alt-coin fatigue. | ADA revisits 2023 lows ($0.24–$0.30). |

For 2026 to allow ADA to retest highs it requires the BTC bull market, which I don't think is a given. My own personal bias on ADA is on the bearish side, but I try to offer some scenarios where my personal bias is wrong.

## 5. Takeaways for Traders & Holders

1. **Mind the unlock calendar.** First NIGHT tranche lands 90 days post-airdrop; size positions accordingly.  
2. **Watch treasury execution.** If OTC desks mis-time sells, on-chain whale moves could front-run further dips.  
3. **Utility, not optics, will decide NIGHT value.** Track Midnight mainnet and real fee burn.  
4. **Yield seekers:** dual-reward staking boosts nominal APR but dilutes real return—model both coins' inflation.  
5. **Value investors:** wait for evidence that BTC reserves *actually* fund ADA buy-backs before treating the pivot as bullish.
