**[The Alchemy of Finance: Reading the Mind of the Market (Paperback)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R6OKMABRNQEC7/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm "Alchemy of finance"),** 26 Aug 2012

First off I'll announce my bias that I agree with the author's premise of how markets can be self-reinforcing and hence display reflexivity. He mentions the idea but I never felt that he really spelt out the idea in any great detail for a layman to understand, there was no obvious sign that pointed to "here's the definition". So while I agree with the idea I wasn't so happy that the idea was ill explained. My second bias is a distrust of Soros's political dealings: vast amount of wealth, dabbles in politics. Not a favourite combination of mine.  
  
Due to said biases I came into this book with mixed expectations. I've heard of Soros as the great speculator and have great respect for some of his big wins (and even some of his losses). I've previously read [More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of the New Elite](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1408809753/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk), which is an interesting book, and I've also read a fair amount about Soros online so I already knew a fair bit about Soros's track record and his way of thinking. From what I had already read about him this book offered nothing new. Perhaps this is putting the cart before the horse, as I'm reading about the ideas long after they are published but I think that if you want to read about his ideas then are better places to go. Ironic as it may seem, this book is too wordy and dry in a theoretical sense that you never get any appreciation for how to apply the ideas practically.  
  
I'd suggest avoiding this one.
