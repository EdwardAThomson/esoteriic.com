I did some calculations that follow on from my earlier post ([Electric Vehicles](/thoughts/20-science-technology-nature/142-building-an-electric-vehicle "Electric Vehicles: build your own"): build your own).

And then I decided to do a few more calculations for known vehicles. The following graph shows power versus weight for achieving 0-100kmh (0-60mph) in 5.6 seconds. I have a public Google document with my calculations. I think power is roughly correct but the number of batteries is probably wrong, I could do with someone fixing that. See here: [Google Doc Power Calcs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjEZ66z4j22wdFprMWR6OFdxazZJTVFwdnZHVkFWaFE "Google Docs: Electric Vehicles Power Calcs")

> Power vs weight calcs for known cars: 0- 100kmh in 5.6 secs. How about an electric Ford Excursion? O.o [twitter.com/edthomson/stat…](http://t.co/3Bi8pNwG "http://twitter.com/edthomson/status/267053744150151169/photo/1")

To create the picture I had to take out some of the names, here is the full list I worked with:

Ariel Atom 614 kg -> 85.96 kW

Koenigsegg Agera R 1290 kg ->180.6 kW

Ford Focus 5dr hatch 1340 kg -> 187.6 kW

Ferrari 458 Italia 1485 kg -> 207.9 kW

Nissan Leaf 1521 kg -> 212.94 kW

Lamborghini Aventador 1575 kg -> 220.5 kW

Ford Explorer 2060 kg ->288.4 kW

Rolls Royce Phantom 2550 kg ->357 kW

Ford Excursion (petrol V10) 3280 kg -> 459.2 kW

I've also done some checks now and the numbers seem pretty good. I check my KiloWatt calculations against horsepower using an online 0-60mph calculator at [auto snout](http://www.autosnout.com/0-60-Calculator.php "0-60 calculator").

Test case:

Rolls Royce Phantom weighs **2550 kg** (5610 lbs), and according to the calculator I need 440hp to get 0-60mph in 5.6 seconds.

From Google: 1 hp ~ 0.7456 kw. ThereforeL **440hp** is **328kW**... and I have 357kW in my spreadsheet calculations.

In related news uploading pictures to Twitter is quite handy, much easier than messing around with c-panel and it gives cross-posting. I'm sure there is a quicker way but... \*shrug\*.
