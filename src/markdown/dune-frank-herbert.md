**\[book review\]**

This book has been the most influential book that I've ever read. I was so absorbed by the computer games and the film as a child that I sometimes lived in this world in my imagination, when I was felt old enough (circa 16/17) to read the book I did and came to appreciate a further level of depth to the characters that is missing from the film. I personally enjoyed the 1980s version of the film, despite strong criticism from many. It is a fairly complex story and merely watching the film once is not enough to appreciate (e.g.) the intricacy of the tensions between the characters and factions.  
  
Dune, the first book of this series is in my opinion the best thing Herbert has ever written. The sequels seem a little bit pale in comparison, somewhat enjoyable (no real regrets) but I feel they depart quite a long way from the original vision. The sixth book practically feels like a different universe. I'd only really advocate for people to read this book and to forget about the sequels unless they really enjoy his universe; Dune, however, is rich enough in depth that people whom are not fans of sci-fi/ fantasy can at least enjoy it as an interesting story.
